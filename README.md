## Getting Started

Before trying to get started, make sure you've installed:

 * [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

First, install your dependencies:

    yarn install

You can then run the local development server with:

    yarn dev

To deploy your changes just push to GitHub. Once they're merged into master
they'll deploy to Heroku and our site automatically in a few minutes.
