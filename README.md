This is repo for the [ExchangeJS website](http://www.exchangejs.com).

## Getting Started

This site was bootstrapped using [https://html5boilerplate.com/](https://html5boilerplate.com/).

You can find some guidance and tips on the site structure in the `docs` folder.

Before trying to get started, make sure you've installed:

 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Install the site dependencies

    npm install

 ### Running the development server

 You can start a development server with:

    npm run dev

Once the development server is running you will be given a local URL where you can view your changes.

To deploy your changes just push to GitHub. Once they're merged into master
they'll deploy to our site automatically.
